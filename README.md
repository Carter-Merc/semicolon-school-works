# Semicolon School Works

This repository contains Python programming exercises completed as part of coursework at Semicolon Africa, a coding bootcamp focused on software development education.

## About This Project

This is a collection of beginner-level Python programming assignments covering fundamental programming concepts including:
- Basic input/output
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Loops (while loops)
- Arithmetic operations
- User input handling
- Basic error handling

## Exercises Included

### 1. **Hello.py**
A basic "Hello World" program - the traditional first program in any programming language.

### 2. **BMI.py**
Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that:
- Takes user's weight and height as input
- Calculates BMI
- Categorizes the result (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)

### 3. **Greetings.py**
A greeting program that provides different greetings based on the user's name input.

### 4. **Guesser.py**
A simple number guessing game where users try to guess a favorite number.

### 5. **Largest3.py**
Finds and displays the largest number among three input numbers using conditional logic.

### 6. **Ticket.py**
Age-based ticket pricing calculator:
- Free for ages ≤5
- $5 for ages 6-12
- $12 for ages 13-64
- $8 for ages ≥65

### 7. **Tripcost.py**
Trip cost calculator that computes the total cost of a trip based on:
- Distance travelled
- Fuel used
- Fuel price

### 8. **Odd-even.py**
Sums odd and even numbers separately from a series of user-provided integers.

### 9. **Pets.py**
A simple program about pet preferences with conditional responses.

### 10. **Safedivision.py**
Demonstrates safe division by checking for division by zero before performing the operation.

### 11. **PrintinaTable.py**
Creates a formatted table showing numbers, their power calculations, and demonstrates tab-separated output.

### 12. **Safedivision..py**
An alternative or backup version of the safe division program.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - All programs are written in Python

## How to Run

Each Python file can be run independently using:
```bash
python <filename>.py
```

For example:
```bash
python Hello.py
python BMI.py
python Ticket.py
```

## Educational Purpose

These exercises are designed to help students practice:
- Python syntax and structure
- Problem-solving skills
- Input validation
- Conditional logic
- Loop constructs
- Basic mathematical operations
